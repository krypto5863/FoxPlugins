# FoxPlugins

## Autumn (3.1)
I never really decided what I wanted Autumn to be, it's a library for developers that makes the creation of UI elements easier, but also has capabilities for localization, settings, and even image editing and retrieval.

## PrismaLib (FINISHED, 1.0)
Library used by developers to store settings, has been superseeded by Autumn.

## SmartRect (FINISHED, 2.41)
Library used by plugin developers, allows the easy creation and control of grid like Rectangles, and also animate them.

## MAESTRO (DISCONTINUED, 1.0)
Plugin that allows to apply non destructive modifiers to items and characters, non-destructive in a sense that if you remove the modifiers, it will revert to it's old form without permanently altering the objects in the scene.

## ColliderSound (1.3)
Plugin that allows the user to load a 16 bit .wav file, and have it play when 2 items are close to each other.

## DBToggler (FINISHED, 1.0)
A plugin that allows the user to disable all dynamic bones in a scene with the press of a key, improving framerate a lot if there are characters that have lots of them.
It was superseeded by Starstorms Performancer plugin.

## GUIverload (DISCONTINUED, 1.2)
This would have been a plugin that would imitate blenders UI and binds, I lost interest in keeping it up though.

## KoiUpdater (Hiatus, 1.0)
A plugin that allows the user, to update their plugin from within koi, it has been currently put on hold, but might see resumed development in the future.

## LHC (DISCONTINUED, 1.0)
Plugin that allows to create, and edit already existing Particle Systems, it's set to discontinued as there are other plugins now that do the exact same thing.

## NonKoiTests (?)
This is not a plugin, but just for me to test other stuff.
